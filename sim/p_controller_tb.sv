// Two checks:
//  1. Exact-math: for known (target, measured) pairs, the computed command
//     must match the formula independently re-derived in the testbench.
//  2. Closed-loop convergence: driving the controller's output through a
//     simple lagging "plant" model (simulating a servo settling toward
//     wherever it's commanded) must converge to the target within N ticks.
